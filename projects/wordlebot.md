WordleBot is a Python program designed to use simple algorithms to determine the most efficient first guess for the popular game 'Wordle' based on the published list of possible words. The code will iterate through every legal guess and compare how close they are to every other word in the list and give it a score based on that. Additionally, the Python file includes functions to determine the next best guess based on what your last one was, and what the game returned for correct and incorrect letters.

This project was my first exposure to Python and helped me learn the language in a challenging environment.
