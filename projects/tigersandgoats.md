Tigers and Goats is a digital port of the board game from South India of the same name. The fundamental goal of this project was to practice machine learning fundamentals using a game that nobody has designed an AI for. The AI is taking the role of the Goat player and is trained to consistently win against a Tiger player using a greedy strategy. I was specifically involved with refining the algorithms used to increase the win rate of the Goat player.
