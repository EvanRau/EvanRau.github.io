---

Animal Farm was the final project for my EE205 course that implements C++ fundamentals to create a database of animals.

Included in this program is the ability to do the following:
* Generate cats that contain information about their weight, gender, color, and name
* Store those cats into a singular linked list and access their data at-will
* Sort the linked list by the age of the addresses the cats are held on

This project helped solidify my understanding of fundamental C++ functions and gave me more practice in working with object-oriented programs
