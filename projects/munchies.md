"UHM... What to Eat?" was the final group project of my ICS314 course. Students were tasked with creating websites that could reasonably be used by individuals on campus.

Our group decided to make a food-based app that would help with making the decision of what to eat easier. We did this by allowing students to create their own accounts with preferences and allowing vendors to make accounts to help their stores gain more exposure. Working on this website helped me gain real-world practice in working on web design and database management.
