### I. Introduction
  Artificial Intelligence has taken the spotlight in recent years when it comes to education controversies. For many educators, it is simply a dangerous tool that allows students to circumvent the learning process by mass-producing low-quality essays. For my ICS 314 class, the professor allowed full use of AI with respect to any and all assignments given. They were more interested in how the tool is utilized in a practical setting by students who have already learned the fundamentals. I personally made heavy use of AI in order to assist with code creation and troubleshooting, with chatGPT as my tool of choice.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18:
As these assignments were intended to be learning tools, I felt that AI was unnecessary since the methods to complete the assignment were given in the instructions
  2. In-class Practice WODs:
I utilized Ai for these exercises to generate boilerplate code in order to save time across the exercise. When prompting GPT, I would generally ask it to generate an example of whatever code is being asked for, and then I would make modifications and corrections to that code in order to better fit the specifications of the assignment. More often than not, prompting chatGPT to generate the generic code was very successful for me in quickly churning out the framework for the assignment
  3. In-class WODs:
My use of AI for the official exercises was virtually identical to the practice ones. Since the official WODs tended to be more complicated than the practice ones, I would sometimes have to re-prompt the AI to regenerate the framework code if there was a glaring problem present.
  4. Essays:
Using AI for writing essays tends to result in poorly constructed essays, so I limited my use of it for my essays. I did, however, use chatGPT in order to help brainstorm topics for essays that I could then go and do further research on.
  5. Final project:
Due to my final project requiring functions that weren't necessarily covered in class, my group and I made use of Artificial intelligence so that we could quickly research and implement the tools that we needed for our project. For example, we needed to implement a filter for various tags relating to types of food, and we were able to use GPT to quickly get a base example of how that would look on the backend that we modified to fit our needs.
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial:
When it specifically came to learning outside of graded assignments, I tend to not use AI since I feel like it can get in the way of the learning process if I'm not looking for a solution to a problem within my code
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord:
I don't usually try to answer questions that I don't already know the solution to, so I have never considered using Artificial Intelligence in this matter.
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question:
As with the prior use case, I don't answer questions that I myself am not 100% confident with my explanation for. As a result, I have never needed to use AI in that way.
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:
This is one of my most common uses for AI as it helps me understand how certain coding functions look in context. This example extends to how I used AI in examples 2 and 3 since those assignments tend to ask for the student to use a specific function in the solution.
  10. Explaining code:
When presented with already-finished code, I usually don't need Artificial Intelligence to explain it to me. 
  11. Writing code:
As shown in examples 2 and 3, I use AI to write boilerplate code to streamline the process often. It allows me to save brainpower on writing the unique code in order to make a program work rather than getting stuck on the monotony of simple for-loops that every junior programmer has written countless times already.
  12. Documenting code:
Ignoring the times when chatGPT documents the framework code that I ask it for, I never use AI to document code that I myself have written. I feel like I know my own code better than it does, and can explain it to 3rd parties better than it could.
  13. Quality assurance:
Depending on what IDE I am working on, I generally don't need AI to help in the debugging process. In IntelliJ, it generates and clearly marks errors in the code that I can acknowledge and correct as they appear. Suppose I have to work in a less robust environment like VIM. In that case, that is generally when I utilize chatGPT to help diagnose the source of the problems I am encountering since error messages are not given as cleanly.
  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above:
I cannot think of any examples where I made use of AI outside of the 13 given above.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
  AI has acted as a dual-edged sword for me when it comes to its impact on my learning. On one hand, it has allowed me to be able to quickly produce code to solve problems that I haven't encountered before. On the other, I feel like my retention of those solutions isn't as solid as if I had taken the longer route of researching the problem on forums such as StackOverflow. It has improved my understanding of software engineering concepts, but in such a way that I also feel that I need to be more cautious in my utilization of it.

### IV. Practical Applications:
  Artificial Intelligence has many practical applications outside of the classroom. In the workplace, it allows for the streamlining of monotonous tasks and allows for employees to dedicate their time to more important objectives. Additionally, it can be used to help brainstorm solutions to problems present in software that is currently being developed.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
  One major hurdle that Artificial Intelligence needs to clear to be more viable is its ability to better grasp context when asking it problems. There will be times when one asks it for a code example and it provides a solution that relies on code that it does not show, and they need to prompt it to go into further depth. Additionally, it can also give incorrect solutions or rely on functions that are very inefficient in the current scenario.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
  Traditional teaching methods in software engineering education often rely on lectures, textbooks, and programming projects. While these methods can provide a foundational understanding, they often struggle to engage students consistently and may not cater to individual learning paces and styles. Utilizing AI in addition to these tools can allow for these weak points to be covered. Furthermore, AI tools can facilitate continuous assessment and feedback, promoting better knowledge retention through spaced repetition and targeted reinforcement. 

### VII. Future Considerations:
  I feel like the future of AI in software engineering is inevitable. The utility it provides in being able to generate boilerplate code that engineers have memorized by heart allows for time to be better allocated towards truly challenging problems inside of a given piece of software. However, I do feel that software engineers should not be threatened by AI, since the average person doesn't know how to ask the right questions in order to get an AI to create a piece of software they desire.

### VIII. Conclusion:
  Overall, I feel like Artificial Intelligence has been a net positive when it comes to software development. While there are problems that have to be faced in other fields, such as the theft of art for training data with AI specialized in creating art, software engineering does not have the same ownership problems that would lead to the same conflicts. In the future, restricting its use to programming assignments may be beneficial in helping with knowledge retention, as students are able to ask for solutions to simple learning problems as well, resulting in them retaining information less reliably.
