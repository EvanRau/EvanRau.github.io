Despite this course being my first exposure to JavaScript, I am finding that my experience with other programming languages is helping me pick this one up faster. Specifically, my time with C++ has allowed me to become more familiar with object-oriented programming, and my knowledge of Python has made the less restrictive object declarations feel less alien. Additionally, I have found that most, if not all, of the syntax commonly used when writing in JavaScript has been something I have already been exposed to.

Upon initial inspection, I do feel that JavaScript is a good programming language for most Software Engineering applications. The only exception I currently hold is that a language such as C may be better if one is designing an operating system from the ground up, due to it having fewer restrictions. On the other hand, C is also a more 'dangerous' language in that respect since many of the tools it offers are only available because the restrictions that would prevent major errors are no longer present.

Concerning Athletic Software Engineering, JavaScript provides more than enough power to be able to work through any practical exercise one would expect to see. The practice WoDs offered by this course provide an opportunity to think outside of the box and hone my problem-solving skills. The format of the course; however, is a cause of stress due to all of the learning being done at home, with the class time being used to practice the skills being developed. I feel it is too soon to say if this method of learning works or not for me.
