While I have been studying computer and software engineering for the past 5 years, my exposure to it extends far beyond that. For as long as I can remember, I have been exposed to computers through my dad's work, and he made sure that we learned how to use them from a young age. I feel it is that early exposure that led me down the career path I am on today.

The most significant experiences I have had with programming have come from my EE205 and EE296 classes, which taught me a great deal about C++ and Python respectively. In my 205 course, we were tasked with creating a database that could store the names and information of various cats in a linked list. This project took up about a third of the semester and taught me many of the programming tricks in C++.

Similarly, I learned a great deal about Python, as well as algorithms in general, in my 296 class, which was the first semester of my Capstone design project. The fresh students to the project were asked to design an algorithm that could determine the best guesses to use in the game Wordle. 

Though all of this is in the recent past, I intend to further improve my knowledge of the field for the duration of my time in school. In particular, I am taking courses on Computational media as it is a subject that feels alien to me despite what I already know. I am also taking a course on software reverse engineering as it is a very useful skill to have for real-world applications.
