Those new to software engineering might look at UI frameworks with confusion. After all, why learn what could potentially be as complicated as a new programming language when they could instead just work directly in HTML? The truth of the matter is that UI frameworks like Bootstrap enable programmers to more efficiently design websites and other software with a unified style.

One of the largest benefits of using a premade framework is that the work has already been done for the user in terms of commonly used utilities. If someone wanted to create a navbar only using HTML, it would take significantly longer to develop and debug than if they used something like Bootstrap's navbar functionality. More often than not, the programmer won't need their navbar to function beyond the capabilities of what has already been designed, so why go through the hassle of creating one from scratch when the work has already been done by somebody else?

Another benefit is that the end product is easier to read when using a UI framework in comparison to pure HTML. UI frameworks are designed to streamline some of the complicated syntax of HTML so that it is easier to work in. Another way to look at it is by comparing a language like C versus Assembly. In the end, C converts its code into assembly in the backend but allows the user to work in a more legible environment.

In the end, while they aren't always needed and should not be treated like a universal solution to HTML design, UI frameworks enable programmers to more efficiently design webpages in a unified style by pushing the workload of creating often-used utilities onto those who have already done it. It may take some time to learn the syntax needed to properly use it, but the payoff is well worth the effort.
