One of the major inconveniences students encounter on campus is not being able to find a vending machine quickly or conveniently. Our proposed solution is a website that catalogs every vending machine on campus, along with photos of what they are stocked with. This way, students will be able to quickly and conveniently see where the nearest source of cheap snacks is!

The general layout would include a landing page containing a map of campus, along with pins for every vending machine. There would be an option to filter pins by whether or not the machine is for food or drinks, as well as what payment options are available. Clicking on a pin would send the user to a separate page containing a picture of the vending machine, its location, as well as other info such as if a keycard is needed to reach it. Admins would have a separate page that allows them to add/edit pins for vending machines.

Beyond the basics, we would include options for the user to notify the admins of new vending machines on campus, as well as if a vending machine has changed its stock in comparison to the current photo. These notifications would have separate pages where the user can submit a photo of the new/updated vending machine, as well as its location. The admins will then be able to decide if the update is valid and push the new photo to the page for the machine. additionally, we would add a rating system by thumbs up/ thumbs down if the machine is prone to stealing a student's money.
