Over the past four months, my journey through the realm of software engineering has been both enriching and dynamic, guiding me through a diverse array of topics essential for professional growth. Among these, a particular emphasis has been placed on understanding the intricacies of development environments and functional programming paradigms.

Concerning development environments, I have learned that using the right tool for the right job is especially critical when it comes to what programming language a developer is using. I was introduced to IntelliJ this semester, and while I was initially hesitant to learn it since I was already used to CLion by the same developer, many of the projects that were assigned during the class would have been significantly more difficult had I not used IntelliJ. The tools it provides are especially useful for web-based development, and CLion would not have been able to keep up in terms of convenient tools.

Functional programming was another aspect of the field that I learned a great deal about. Most of the coding projects I had written up until now were not meant to be seen by 3rd parties. In this class, however, many of the assignments were based on providing a good visual design for potential users of what I was writing code for. While many of the weekly exercises were specifically about designing visually appealing UI, the final project in particular acted as a trial by fire since it was actually going to be used by other parties. I realized some of the design choices I made for my own benefit worked against the average user's best interests, and I was forced to change my habits accordingly.

To conclude, the past four months of exploration of software engineering have been enlightening, particularly in understanding development environments and functional programming paradigms. Embracing IntelliJ over CLion underscored the importance of selecting the right tools for efficient web-based development. Similarly, delving into functional programming revealed the significance of user-centric design, challenging and refining my coding habits. This journey has equipped me with invaluable insights into optimizing development processes and prioritizing user experience, empowering me for future endeavors in the field.
