While many junior programmers may see coding standards as trivial minutiae that don't truly matter for personal projects, history shows that even individual projects can leave a lasting legacy on the internet. Utilities such as OpenSSL and core-js, despite only being maintained by one or two people, have become integral to countless pieces of software. If you stray from coding standards and write your code so that only you can understand it, nobody else will be able to update it once you are no longer able to.

Furthermore, adherence to coding standards not only ensures the maintainability and accessibility of code beyond its creator's tenure but also fosters collaboration and scalability within development teams. Consistent coding practices facilitate smoother integration of new members into projects, as they can quickly grasp the structure and style of existing code. Additionally, when code conforms to established standards, it becomes more modular and adaptable, enabling easier iteration and expansion as project requirements evolve. In this way, coding standards serve as a linchpin for sustained project success, promoting cohesion and efficiency in development efforts.
